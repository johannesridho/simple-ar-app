# simple-ar-app
A simple Augmented Reality application using Unity and Vuforia. 
This application was made for a tech talk at Facebook Developer Circles Jakarta meetup along with my presentation slide https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1r9Qv7Nh4JxB_VFA0f7pZlhcpDBMLWEZv-Sgk40F-hoo/edit?usp=sharing.

## How to Run
```
1. Install Unity and register at Vuforia
2. If not chosen, choose MainScene at Scene directory
3. Create your own Vuforia License Key, and add it into Vuforia Configuration
4. Use your own ImageTarget, and replace the existing ImageTarget GameObject
5. Test and run the app
```
